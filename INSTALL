Get Glut (glut is in the MesaDemos package)

Sound File Formats:
The game supports the following sound file formats:
- MOD (ProTracker)
- XM (FastTracker 2)
- S3M (ScreamTracker 3)
- IT (Impulse Tracker)
- WAV (requires additional libraries: libvorbis, libflac)

Additional Required Libraries:

For full functionality, you may need to install the following additional libraries:

1. For sound support (if using MikMod):
   - libmikmod-dev (or equivalent for your distribution)
   - libvorbis-dev (for WAV file support)
   - libflac-dev (for WAV file support)
   - libogg-dev (dependency for libvorbis)

2. For OpenGL support:
   - mesa-common-dev (or equivalent for your distribution)
   - libglu1-mesa-dev (or equivalent)

3. For GUI support:
   - libx11-dev
   - libxext-dev
   - libxi-dev
   - libxmu-dev
   - libxt-dev

4. For development tools:
   - cmake (version 3.10 or higher)
   - make
   - gcc or clang

5. For Android development (if building for Android):
   - Android NDK
   - Android SDK
   - OpenGL ES libraries
   - EGL libraries
   - GLESv2 libraries
   - Android log library

Installation Commands for Common Linux Distributions:

Debian/Ubuntu:
% sudo apt-get install libmikmod-dev libvorbis-dev libflac-dev libogg-dev \
  mesa-common-dev libglu1-mesa-dev libx11-dev libxext-dev libxi-dev \
  libxmu-dev libxt-dev cmake make gcc

Fedora/RHEL/CentOS:
% sudo dnf install mikmod-devel libvorbis-devel flac-devel libogg-devel \
  mesa-libGL-devel mesa-libGLU-devel libX11-devel libXext-devel \
  libXi-devel libXmu-devel libXt-devel cmake make gcc

Arch Linux:
% sudo pacman -S mikmod vorbis flac ogg mesa glu libx11 libxext libxi \
  libxmu libxt cmake make gcc

MacOS (using Homebrew):
% brew install mikmod vorbis flac ogg mesa glu cmake

Windows (using vcpkg):
% vcpkg install mikmod vorbis flac ogg mesa glu

Installation (without sound)

% mkdir build-pc
% cd build-pc
% cmake -DUSE_SOUND=OFF ..
% make
% ./gltron

Installation (with sound)

Get libmikmod and install it

% mkdir build-pc
% cd build-pc
% cmake ..
% make
% ./gltron

Optionally:

% sudo cmake --build build-pc --target install

will install gltron in GLTRON_INSTALLDIR and gltron.it (if present),
settings.txt, menu.txt, helvetica.txf in GLTRON_HOME as defined in the
CMakeLists.txt.  By default, GLTRON_INSTALLDIR is /usr/bin and
GLTRON_HOME is /usr/share/games/gltron.

gltron will look for the following files:

gltron.it (only if compiled with sound)
settings.txt menu.txt gltron.sgi gltron_floor.sgi gltron_wall.sgi
xenotron.ftx xenotron.0.sgi xenotron.1.sgi t-u-low.obj tron.mtl

If the environment variable GLTRON_HOME is defined, it will look
there first, ./ second, /usr/share/games/gltron third and at last in
/usr/local/share/games/gltron. If you do a cmake --build build-pc --target install and have changed
GLTRON_HOME, you _must_ set the GLTRON_HOME environment variable.

You might also want to put the GLTRON_HOME environment variable into
your ~/.profile (bash) or ~/.tcshrc (tcsh).

Start gltron with the -s option if you don't want the sound playing.

These instructions are very brief. I'd be glad if someone could write
them better.

Android Requirements:

For Android, you need to have the Android NDK and Android SDK installed.
You also need to have the following libraries installed:

- OpenGL ES
- EGL
- GLESv2
- log
- android

You can install these libraries using the Android SDK Manager.

Android Installation (NDK cross-compile notes):

% mkdir build-android
% cd build-android
% cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=$ANDROID_NDK/build/cmake/android.toolchain.cmake -DANDROID_ABI=arm64-v8a -DANDROID_PLATFORM=android-21 ..
% cmake --build . --config Release

Notes:
- The Android build produces native libraries/binaries for integration into an Android app. You do not run ./gltron directly on device.
- The project currently does not include an Android activity or packaging. You can link the produced library/binary into your own Android app project that sets up EGL/GLES context and input.
- The CMake build defines ANDROID and links against log, android, EGL, and GLESv2.

Optionally:

% cmake --build build-android --target install

will install gltron artifacts to the specified Android staging directory.
