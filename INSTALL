Installation (general things).

for URL's on how to get these packages see
http://www.ards.net/Andreas/gltron.html#links

Get a working OpenGL / Mesa
Get Glut (glut is in the MesaDemos package)

Installation (without sound)

% mkdir build-pc
% cd build-pc
% cmake -DUSE_SOUND=OFF ..
% make
% ./gltron

Installation (with sound)

Get libmikmod and install it

% mkdir build-pc
% cd build-pc
% cmake ..
% make
% ./gltron

Optionally:

% sudo cmake --build build-pc --target install

will install gltron in GLTRON_INSTALLDIR and gltron.it (if present),
settings.txt, menu.txt, helvetica.txf in GLTRON_HOME as defined in the
CMakeLists.txt.  By default, GLTRON_INSTALLDIR is /usr/bin and
GLTRON_HOME is /usr/share/games/gltron.

gltron will look for the following files:

gltron.it (only if compiled with sound)
settings.txt menu.txt gltron.sgi gltron_floor.sgi gltron_wall.sgi
xenotron.ftx xenotron.0.sgi xenotron.1.sgi t-u-low.obj tron.mtl

If the environment variable GLTRON_HOME is defined, it will look
there first, ./ second, /usr/share/games/gltron third and at last in
/usr/local/share/games/gltron. If you do a cmake --build build-pc --target install and have changed
GLTRON_HOME, you _must_ set the GLTRON_HOME environment variable.

You might also want to put the GLTRON_HOME environment variable into
your ~/.profile (bash) or ~/.tcshrc (tcsh).

Start gltron with the -s option if you don't want the sound playing.

These instructions are very brief. I'd be glad if someone could write
them better.

Android Requirements:

For Android, you need to have the Android NDK and Android SDK installed.
You also need to have the following libraries installed:

- OpenGL ES
- EGL
- GLESv2
- log
- android

You can install these libraries using the Android SDK Manager.

Android Installation:

% mkdir build-android
% cd build-android
% cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=$ANDROID_NDK/build/cmake/android.toolchain.cmake -DANDROID_ABI=arm64-v8a -DANDROID_PLATFORM=android-21 ..
% make
% ./gltron

Optionally:

% cmake --build build-android --target install

will install gltron in the specified Android directory.
